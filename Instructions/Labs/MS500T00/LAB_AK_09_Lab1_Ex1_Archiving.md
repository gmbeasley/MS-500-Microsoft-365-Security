# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Initialize Compliance 

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Security Administrator, you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. As you proceed with your Microsoft 365 pilot project, your next steps are to implement archiving and retention at Adatum.  

### Task 1 – Activate In-Place Archiving

In this next phase of your Adatum pilot project, you will access the Security & Compliance Center to activate Holly Dickson’s archive mailbox.   

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). Click **Data lifecycle management** in the left pane and then click **Archive**. 

3. On the **Archive** window, note that the archive mailboxes for all users other than Holly Dickson are enabled. These archive mailboxes were enabled when the VMs were built for this training course and these users were preconfigured in the tenant. However, since you added Holly in an earlier lab, her archive mailbox is disabled by default.

4. To enable Holly’s archive mailbox, type Holly in **Search** box at top right and enter, click the three vertical dots to the right of the name, click the three vertical dots to the right of the name, then click **Enable archive** on the submenu that opens. 

5. On the **Warning** screen that opens, click **Enable** to confirm. 

1. Back on the **Archive** tab, click **Refresh** to see that the **Archive mailbox** status for Holly Dickson has changed to **Enabled**.
